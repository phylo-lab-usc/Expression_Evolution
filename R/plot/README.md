This folder contains R code used to generate the main figures. Data files required as input are in directory Expression_Evolution/output/

plot_basic.R is for results of simulations along replicate lineages in the presence of stabilizing selection on the protein level or under neutrality.

plot_basic_space.R is used to generate heatmaps that show correlations between traits under different combinations of effective population size and fitness function SD.

plot_tr_div.R is used to plot pairwise phenotypic difference against phylogenetic distance given results of simulations along a phylogenetic tree.

plot_tr_fit.R is used to plot results of model fitting based on results of simulations along a tree.

plot_interaction.R is used to generate heatmaps that show correlations between traits under different combinations of interaction parameters.

plot_basic_dir.R is for results of simulations along replicate lineages in the presence of directiuonal selection on the protein level.
