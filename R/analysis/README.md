add_error.R adds measurement error to results of simulations along replicate lineages and generate data subject to error.

add_error_tree.R adds measurement error to results of simulations along a phylogenetic tree and generate data subject to error.

fit.R performs model fitting given results of simulations along a phylogenetic tree and gives AICc weights of models.
