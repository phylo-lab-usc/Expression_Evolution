This folder contains phenotypic data subject to measurement errors.

A zero at the beginning of the file name indicates neutrality. Otherwise the data file is for evolution under stabilizing selection.

Number at the end of the file name is SD of measurement error (0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, or 0.05).

Columns of each file correspond to: effective population size, fitness function SD, the mRNA level, the translation rate, and the protein level (when there is stabilizing selection).

Columns of each file correspond to: the mRNA level, the translation rate, and the protein level (under neutrality).
