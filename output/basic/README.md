This folder contains simulation results produced by sim_basic.R. Different independent simulations can be interpreted as either replicate lineages or genes.

Default parameter values: Ne=1e3, T=1e6, width=1, sig=0.1, u=1 (see annotations in the code for their meanings).

Files with "neutral" in their names are simulation results obtained under neutrality. Files with "var" in their names are for variance across independent simulations through time. Files with "end" in their names contain end-point phenotypes.
