This folder contains results for two interaction genes. Variances of genotypic values and phenotypes were written every 10 time steps. Correlation between genotypic values and phenotypic variance ratios were written at the end of simulation for each parameter combination.

Columns of each data file represent: 

Effect of gene 1 on gene 2

Effect of gene 2 on gene 1

Time at which the result is written

Variance of genotypic value of gene 1's transcription rate

Variance of genotypic value of gene 1's translation rate

Variance of genotypic value of gene 2's transcription rate

Variance of genotypic value of gene 2's translation rate

Variance of gene 1's mRNA level

Variance of gene 1's protein level

Variance of gene 2's mRNA level

Variance of gene 2's protein level

Correlation between gene 1's transcription and translation rates

Correlation between gene 2's transcription and translation rates

Correlation between gene 1's mRNA and protein levels

Correlation between gene 2's mRNA and protein levels

Ratio of variances of gene 1's mRNA and protein levels

Ratio of variances of gene 2's mRNA and protein levels

Files with "end" in their names only contain results written at the end of the simulation (T=10000) and the column for time is deleted for these files.

Files with "pt1" in their names contain results of simulations where only one gene is subject to direct selection on its protein level. Files with "pt2" in their names contain results of simulations where both genes are subject to direct selection on their protein levels.
