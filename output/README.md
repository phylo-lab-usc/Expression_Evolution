This folder contains output files of the simulations.

./basic contains results of simulations on replicate lineages for a single gene in the presence of stabilizing selection on the protein level or under neutrality.

./tree contains results of simulations along a phylogenetic tree for a single gene.

./interaction contains results of simulations for interacting genes.

./directional contains results of simulations for single or multiple genes in the presence of directional selection on the protein level.
