This folder contains results of simulations for functionally equivalent genes.

1_out_redundant_end.txt: End-point phenotypes when the total protein level is under stabilizing selection.
Columns correspond to: gene 1's mRNA level, gene 1's translation rate, gene 2's mRNA level, gene 2's translation rate, gene 1's protein level, gene 2's protein level.

0_out_redundant_end.txt: End-point phenotypes under neutrality.
Columns correspond to: gene 1's mRNA level, gene 1's translation rate, gene 2's mRNA level, gene 2's translation rate, gene 1's protein level, gene 2's protein level.
