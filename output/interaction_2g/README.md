This folder contains simulations for 2 interacting genes.<br />
Output for each parameter combination would be compressed into a package. File names are in "width_C12_C21" format, where width is standard deviation of the fitness function (0 for neutrality), C12 is gene 1's effect on gene 2, and C21 is gene 2's effect on gene 1.<br />
Package content: <br />
End-point genotypic values (gt_end.txt) and phenotypes (pt_end.txt) for all lineages<br />
Correlation matrix for end-point genotypic values and phenotypes (cor_mat.txt)<br />
Variances of genotypic values and phenotypes through time (var_all.txt)<br />
Folder for each replicate lineage's genotypic values (gt_all.txt) and phenotypes (pt_all.txt) through time<br />
