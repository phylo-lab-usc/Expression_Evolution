This folder contains results of simulations with directional selection. All phenotypes are in log scale.

1_1_out_basic_end.txt: End-point mRNA level, translation rate, and protein level of a single gene in replicate lineages.
Columns correspond to: the mRNA level, the translation rate, the protein level.

1_1_out_basic_var.txt: Variances of the mRNA level, the translation rate, and the protein level of a single gene across replicate lineages through time.
Columns correspond to: time, variance of the mRNA level, variance of the translation rate, variance of the protein level.

multi_1_out_basic_end.txt: End-point mRNA level, translation rate, and protein level of multiple genes in replicate lineages.
Columns correspond to: Optimal protein level of the gene, the mRNA level, the translation rate, the protein level.
