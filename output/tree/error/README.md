This folder contains phenotypic data subject to measurement error.

Meaning of filenames: the number at the beginning indicates if there is selection (0 means no selection, 1 means there is stabilizing selection and SD of the fitness function is 1); the number at the end is SD of measurement error (0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, or 0.05).

Columns of each file correpond to: Columns of the table correspond to: mRNA level of species 1, translation rate of species 1, protein level of species 1, mRNA level of species 2, translation rate of species 2, protein level of species 2, ..., mRNA level of species 50, translation rate of species 50, protein level of species 50.
